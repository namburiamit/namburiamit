# 👋 Hi there, I'm Amit Namburi

I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at **UC San Diego**, focusing on **multimodal learning**, **LLMs**, and **recommender system**. I work on applying deep learning to real-world problems in music intelligence, Language models, and scalable AI infrastructure.

📌 Currently working on building **Conversational Recommender Systems** in the music domain using LLMs along with publicly available music understanding platforms like reddit.
